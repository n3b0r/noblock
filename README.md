# What is that?

That is a Google Chrome Extension to disable stoppers when you have an Ads blocker enabled on your browser. 

## Background

When you use an Ad Blocker some pages display a message talking about to disable the blocker for this webpage.

This extension disables this message and allows you to continue browsing into the webpage.

### Target

This extension works well, especially with Spanish digital newspapers.
